# Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to our Frontend Coding Challenge.

Please read everything here before you start!

## The Challenge

We need a landing page for a customer's last minute business in Greece in the summer.

Unfortunately we have very little time (2-3 days) to implement this. Our product stakeholders and UX/UI colleagues are all already on vacation or otherwise scheduled. So there is neither a design nor mockups available, nor have images been created or optimized.

So it's up to you to be creative and design and implement a landing page.

We were able to elicit some information from the product colleagues before they went on vacation.

And these are the following:

Must have
- Must be responsive from desktop to smartphone (smallest view 320px)
- Should not show up in the index of search engines
- Minimum 6 offer teasers with a picture, hotel name, location (country, region, city) and a price
- Large Hero image at the top of the page with overlay text
- Small contact form consisting of name, email (mandatory field) and a small note (mandatory field).

Bonus Features
- Accessible as far as possible
- List of benefits of Greece
- Map view with random markers from the region
- A small current weather view of the current weather situation

Technical framework is as follows:

- For images please use Unsplash API <https://unsplash.com/developers> to generate images.
- For map view please use OpenstreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>
- For the weather view please use Weatherstack <https://weatherstack.com/>
- Contact form does not need to have a send function. But a validation must be available.

Further ideas or creative content is now completely up to you.

## Coding Requirements

We don't want you to use any frameworks for JavaScript (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, ...) or CSS (Bootstrap, Tailwind,...).

You should program in vanilla JavaScript and create your own stylings.

But you are allow to use npm libraries like axios.

You should take 2-3 days for the challenge, as defined in the description. Please do not take longer.

When you don't finish all "must have" requirements, that's no problem for you and of course for us. You do not fail the test! Let's discuss later what blocked you to finish everything.

## How to start

You please fork from our repository to your personal GitHub account. Your new repository should be set to public so that we can view it later.

We are not only interested in the final result, but also in the steps you have taken. Please try to develop a plan for yourself and then implement it in small steps, each of which you commit to the repository with Git.

## How to use

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run project

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Final Approvement

After a maximum of 4 days after you receive the test from us, we will look at your code and contact you by mail.

We will then arrange an interview where you first present your solution and we will ask you questions about your code.
